            <b>Dominic Adragna</b> is a programmer and game developer.
            He mostly develops indie games and enjoys recreating retro games such as <i>Minesweeper</i>.
            Most of his free time is spent programming and testing his games, and he is facinated by the challenging process of developing.
            Occasionally he puts his skills to the test by attempting to write a game within a strict time limit--which is comparable to a self-hosted game jam.
